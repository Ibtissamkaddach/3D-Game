# The 3D-Game
Creating a 3D game in C++ is a complex task that typically involves using a game engine or a graphics library to handle rendering, physics, and other game mechanics. Below, I will outline my steps for the attempt to create a basic 3D game using the Irrlicht Engine, a powerful open-source graphics engine written in C++. The game features basic movement controls and displays a 3D object.

## Features

- Basic 3D rendering
- Simple keyboard controls for moving the camera
- Loading and displaying a 3D object

## Prerequisites

- [Irrlicht Engine](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/)
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Download and extract the Irrlicht Engine:**
   - Go to the [Irrlicht Engine website](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) and download the latest version.
   - Extract the downloaded Irrlicht Engine to a directory on your system, e.g., `C:/Irrlicht`.

2. **Install CMake:**
   - Follow the instructions on the [CMake website](https://cmake.org/install/) to install CMake.

3. **Install a C++ compiler:**
   - On Windows, you can use Visual Studio.
   - On Linux, you can use GCC or Clang.
   - On macOS, you can use Xcode or install GCC/Clang.

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ibtissamkaddach/3D-Game.git
   cd My3DGame
